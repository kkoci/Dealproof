# DealProof — Claude Code Guide

## Project

**DealProof** is a verifiable AI negotiation system. Two Claude Sonnet agents (buyer + seller)
negotiate a data deal entirely inside an Intel TDX Trusted Execution Environment on Phala Cloud.
When they agree, the CPU produces a cryptographic DCAP attestation quote — hardware-signed proof
that neither agent cheated, the data was what the seller claimed, and the deal terms are tamper-proof.

Trust stack: TDX enclave (environment) → DCAP attestation (code) → Contexto memory (attested
inputs) → πCreds behavioral credentials (attested conduct) → Auditor witness (attested compliance
report) → Arbitrator (attested deadlock resolution).

## Environment Constraints

DealProof runs inside a Phala Cloud Intel TDX CVM in production.

**DNS**: UDP port 53 is blocked inside the CVM. Always use DNS-over-HTTPS via httpx:
`https://1.1.1.1/dns-query` with `Accept: application/dns-json`. Port 443 is open.

**Secrets**: always read from `.env` via `app/config.py` (Pydantic Settings). Never hardcode
API keys, private keys, or contract addresses.

**Attestation-first**: clients MUST call `GET /api/attest` before sending any payload.
Verify `mrenclave` matches the known build measurement, then POST. The attestation is a
privacy prerequisite, not a response artifact. (Andrew Miller feedback, June 3 2026.)

## Actual Request Flow (`routes.py` → `_negotiate_deal`)

```
Step 0   DKIM email proof (optional, non-fatal)
           verify_email_proof() via DoH
           verified_domain injected into SellerAgent system prompt

Step 1   Props verification (optional, fail-fast HTTP 400 on failure)
           compute_merkle_root(chunk_hashes)
           produces data_verification_attestation TDX quote

Step 1b  On-chain escrow deposit (Phase 4, optional)

Step Q   DataQualityAgent (optional, non-fatal)
           DataQualityAgent.assess(data_description, quality_metrics) → DataQualityReport
           quality_hash included in TDX re-attestation
           quality_context injected into BuyerAgent + SellerAgent system prompts

Step M1  Contexto memory pre-deal
           search_memories() → inject context into agent prompts
           get_memory_hash() → memory_hash (state A)

Step 3   Negotiation loop
           BuyerAgent ↔ SellerAgent (AsyncAnthropic)
           ArbitratorAgent called if max_rounds exhausted without agreement (non-fatal)
             → agreed=True + arbitrated=True if arbitration succeeds

Step M2  (if agreed) Contexto memory post-deal
           add_memories() for both agents
           get_memory_hash() → memory_hash_post (state B)

Step P   (if agreed) πCreds audit
           audit_agent_policy() × 2
           audit_deal_conduct()
           hash_credentials() → picreds_hash

Step A   (if agreed) Auditor compliance witness
           AuditorAgent.audit() → AuditReport
           audit_credential_hash = SHA-256(report fields)
           audit_credential_hash = SHA-256(report fields)
           Re-attest: SHA-256(deal + hashA + hashB + picreds_hash + audit_credential_hash + quality_hash) → TDX quote

Step 3b  (if agreed) On-chain escrow release

Step 4   Persist DealResult to SQLite, return response
```

Props verification runs BEFORE the negotiation loop. Memory is split: recall before,
store after. πCreds, Auditor, and post-deal memory only run on agreement.
Arbitrator runs inside the negotiation loop only when max_rounds is exhausted without agreement.

**Resilience guarantees:**
- Memory sidecar down → deal proceeds, `memory_attested: false`
- πCreds audit fails → deal proceeds, `picreds: null`, `picreds_attested: false`
- DKIM fails → deal proceeds, `dkim_verification.verified: false`
- Auditor fails → deal proceeds, `audit_report: null`
- Arbitrator fails → negotiation returns `agreed: false` as before

Run tests: `pytest tests/ -v` (no Docker, no tappd required)

## πCreds Eval Architecture

`app/picreds/constraints.py` runs **before** the LLM audit in `audit_deal_conduct()`.
It contains pure deterministic functions — no LLM, no network. Verifiable from transcript alone.

**Hard constraint booleans are authoritative — code overrides LLM output:**
```python
"buyer_budget_respected":    constraint_results["buyer_budget"].passed   # NOT from LLM
"seller_floor_respected":    constraint_results["seller_floor"].passed   # NOT from LLM
"no_sudden_capitulation":    constraint_results["capitulation"].passed   # NOT from LLM
"convergence_pattern_valid": constraint_results["convergence"].passed    # NOT from LLM
"genuine_negotiation": False if any_hard_failure else llm.get("genuine_negotiation", True)
```

`genuine_negotiation` is `False` if **any** hard check fails, regardless of what the LLM returns.
The LLM prompt also states this explicitly so its assessment text is consistent.

**Checks implemented** (in `constraints.py`):
- `check_buyer_budget_respected` — every buyer offer ≤ buyer_budget
- `check_seller_floor_respected` — every seller offer ≥ floor_price
- `check_no_sudden_capitulation` — no agent moves > `capitulation_threshold` (default `0.40`) in one round
- `check_convergence_pattern` — buyer prices non-decreasing, seller prices non-increasing

**`check_minimum_rounds` is intentionally absent and must not be added.**
A fast deal (seller opens at an acceptable price, buyer accepts) is not a protocol violation.
Requiring multiple rounds produces false positives on legitimate quick agreements.

`CAPITULATION_THRESHOLD = 0.40` is a module-level constant in `constraints.py`, configurable
per call via `run_all_checks(..., capitulation_threshold=0.40)`.

---

## Auditor + Arbitrator Architecture

### AuditorAgent (`app/agents/auditor.py`)

Read-only TEE witness. Called from `routes.py` (Step A) after πCreds on every agreed deal.
Makes one Claude call; returns `AuditReport` or `None` on failure.

```python
@dataclass
class AuditReport:
    genuine_negotiation: bool   # qualitative — did agents bargain authentically?
    round_count: int
    final_price: float
    summary: str                # one-sentence characterisation
    credential_hash: str        # SHA-256(fields, sort_keys=True) — in TDX report_data
```

Structural checks (`monotonic_convergence`, `within_bounds`, `capitulation`) are intentionally
absent — they belong in `app/picreds/constraints.py` where they run deterministically.
An LLM can misfire on these (confirmed in production: Auditor incorrectly flagged buyer opening
below seller floor as a convergence failure). The Auditor's scope is qualitative only.

The Auditor is independent of πCreds — it receives the same transcript but has no knowledge
of the πCreds findings. It is an additional attestation layer, not a replacement.

### ArbitratorAgent (`app/agents/arbitrator.py`)

Deadlock resolver. Called from inside `run_negotiation()` when `max_rounds` is exhausted
without agreement. Passed as `arbitrator=ArbitratorAgent()` from `routes.py`.

```python
@dataclass
class ArbitrationResult:
    proposed_price: float   # clamped to [floor_price, buyer_budget] in code
    rationale: str
    arbitrated: bool = True
```

**Price clamping is enforced in code regardless of LLM output:**
```python
price = max(floor_price, min(buyer_budget, price))
```

Passing `arbitrator=None` to `run_negotiation()` skips arbitration entirely (used in tests
that don't want arbitration to activate).

**`arbitration_enabled` flag is intentionally absent** — the arbitrator is always active
when an `ArbitratorAgent` instance is passed. Control it by passing `None` instead.

---

## DataQualityAgent Architecture

`app/agents/data_quality.py` runs at **Step Q** — before memory recall and before the
negotiation loop — when `quality_metrics` is provided in `DealCreate`.

### Flow

```
DealCreate.quality_metrics (DataQualityMetrics)
  → DataQualityAgent.assess(data_description, metrics)
      → one Claude call → DataQualityReport
          → build_quality_context(report, "buyer")  → injected into BuyerAgent system prompt
          → build_quality_context(report, "seller") → injected into SellerAgent system prompt
          → report.quality_hash                     → included in TDX re-attestation payload
  → DealResult.data_quality_report (dict)
  → DealResult.quality_attested (bool)
```

### DataQualityMetrics (DealCreate field)

```python
class DataQualityMetrics(BaseModel):
    row_count: int
    column_names: list[str]
    null_rates: dict[str, float]          # column → null rate 0.0–1.0
    label_column: str | None              # target column name
    label_distribution: dict[str, float] | None  # {"normal": 0.842, "anomaly": 0.158}
    schema_valid: bool = True
    additional_notes: str | None
```

### DataQualityReport

```python
@dataclass
class DataQualityReport:
    completeness_score: float   # mean(1 - null_rate) across columns
    schema_consistent: bool
    label_distribution: dict | None
    quality_issues: list[str]   # e.g. "12.4% null rate in pressure_hpa column"
    overall_quality: str        # "high" | "medium" | "low"
    summary: str                # one sentence
    quality_hash: str           # SHA-256(report fields) — in TDX report_data
```

### What agents see

Both agents receive a `[TEE-VERIFIED DATASET QUALITY CREDENTIAL]` block in their system
prompts containing `overall_quality`, `completeness_score`, `quality_issues`, and
`label_distribution`. The buyer is told to cite issues when negotiating down; the seller is
told to be transparent and price issues in proactively.

### Resilience

DataQualityAgent is non-fatal. If it fails, `data_quality_report: null`, `quality_attested: false`,
and agents proceed without quality context — same pattern as memory, πCreds, Auditor.

## ETHGlobal NYC — TinyCloud Integration

**Context:** DealProof integrates with TinyCloud's Listen app. Listen stores Fireflies/Google Meet
transcripts in TinyCloud KV/SQL on a Phala TEE CVM (`api.listen.tinycloud.xyz`). DealProof runs
on its own Phala TEE CVM. Both are TEE-native — two attested processes, verifiable end-to-end.

**TinyCloud repos:** `TinyCloud/feed` (CLI read tooling) + `TinyCloud/listen` (transcript backend)

**TinyCloud transcript data shape** (`NormalizedTranscriptSentence`):
```python
{
    "index": int,             # 0-based position
    "speaker_id": str,        # slugified name e.g. "alice-johnson"
    "speaker_name": str,      # human-readable
    "text": str,
    "start_time": float | None,
    "end_time": float | None,
    "language": str | None,   # null → coerce to "en"
}
```
Stored in TinyCloud KV at: `xyz.tinycloud.listen/transcript/{conversationId}`
Conversations in SQL at: `xyz.tinycloud.listen/conversations` (`conversation` table)
258/282 conversations have pre-generated `summary` — prefer summary over raw sentences for tokens.

**Demo flow:**
```
POST /api/transcripts/ingest  (corpus_id, mode="local"|"tinycloud"|"direct", ...)
  → corpus_root, seller_proof

POST /api/deals/run  (data_hash: corpus_root, seller_proof, buyer_budget, ...)
  → deal_id, attestation

POST /api/deals/{id}/credential
  → TeamDynamicsCredential + TDX quote + Arc tx + Hedera tx
```

**Three ingest modes** (`POST /api/transcripts/ingest`):

| mode | what it does | when to use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `direct` | uses `conversations` array in the request body | tests, synthetic data |
| `local` | reads `TinyCloud/feed/conversations.json` + `TinyCloud/feed/transcripts/*.json` | dev, offline |
| `tinycloud` | fetches live via the bridge at `http://localhost:4098` | fresh data, CI |

**Bridge** (`TinyCloud/bridge.ts`, port 4098):
- Why: TinyCloud node requires UCAN delegation auth + specific TLS JA3 fingerprint; Python httpx fails both
- What: Bun script that wraps the `tc` CLI (auth handled by tc's existing session)
- Exposes: `POST /v1/sql`, `GET /v1/kv/:key`, `GET /health`
- Run from `TinyCloud/feed/`: `TC_BIN=./node_modules/.bin/tc bun run ../bridge.ts`

**Local corpus files** (saved via bulk download, not committed):
- `TinyCloud/feed/conversations.json` — 449 SQL rows
- `TinyCloud/feed/transcripts/rec-*.json` — 225 KV transcript blobs

**Session key patch** (one-time after `tc init`):
`~/.tinycloud/profiles/listen/session.json` stores only the public key in `jwk`; `key.json` has the private key.
Fix: copy `key.json` → `session.json.jwk` (see `TinyCloud/TINYCLOUD_WORKFLOW.md` § Step 3).

**Prize targets:** ENS ($4k) + Arc ($2k) + Hedera ($3k) + Unlink ($1k) + World ($2.5k) = $12.5k

---

## Deployment Notes

**`docker-compose.phala.yml` is gitignored** — it contains production env var placeholders and must not be committed. The file lives only on disk and is uploaded manually to the Phala dashboard. After any change, rebuild and push only the app image:
```
docker compose build app && docker compose push app
```
Memory service (`kkoci/dealproof-memory`) is unchanged — push only when `memory-service/` changes.

---

## What NOT to Build

- **Negotiation transcript Merkle tree** — rejected. TDX quote over final state is sufficient.
  Props Merkle (`app/props/verifier.py`) is different and stays.
- **TEE Postgres** — SQLite is inside the CVM trust boundary. A remote attested DB adds
  complexity with no security gain at current scale.
- **Fancy frontend before backend is complete** — frontend is lowest priority.
  Sequencing: piCreds locally → deploy to CVM → frontend last.

---

## Workflow Rules

### On every feature or fix

1. Write or update tests for the changed behaviour — run `pytest` and confirm 0 failures.
2. Run `pytest tests/ -v` before marking anything done.
3. Update the relevant section of `README.md` if phase status or test count changes.
4. Never break the resilience guarantees (memory/πCreds/DKIM/Auditor/Arbitrator all non-fatal).

### On errors

Note the root cause and fix in a comment or commit message. Keep `app/tee/` and
`app/memory/` changes conservative — these touch the attestation chain.

### On attestation changes

Any change to what goes into `report_data` (the SHA-256 payload sent to tappd) must update:
- `app/tee/attestation.py` — the hash construction
- `tests/test_tee.py` — the expected report_data
- `README.md` — the "What the TDX Quote Covers" section

---

## Test Payloads (PowerShell one-liners)

See **`PAYLOADS.md`** for the full reference: deal payloads, transcript ingest payloads,
and synthetic eval datasets (including the healthy-team / conflict-team corpora for Andrew).

Quick summary of what's in `PAYLOADS.md`:
- Standard deals (vision / medical / financial) with and without `seller_proof`
- Transcript ingest: `local`, `tinycloud`, and `direct` mode examples
- Real-transcript ingest: `rec-03bd0ce45a46ee5aa60175e1` (7 sentences, pre-hashed)
- Synthetic eval corpora: Eval 1 (healthy team), Eval 2 (conflict team), Eval 3 (summary-only),
  Eval 4 (mixed corpus stress test)
- End-to-end deal payloads using eval corpus roots as `data_hash`

Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8000/docs` → POST /api/deals/run → Try it out

All three payloads include `seller_proof` (activates `data_verification_attestation`).
`seller_email_eml` and escrow fields require real infrastructure and are not included here.

## Deal Room Product (`product/deal-room` branch)

**Do not change the backend attestation flow, πCreds logic, or agent behavior.**
The product wraps what exists; it does not replace it.

### Phase 1 — Auth + Room Creation ✅ Complete

New backend files:
- `app/api/room_routes.py` — `/api/room/*` endpoints (seller register, buyer register, status poll)
- `app/api/room_schemas.py` — `SellerRegisterRequest`, `BuyerRegisterRequest`, `RoomCreateResponse`, `BuyerJoinResponse`, `RoomStatusResponse`

New db functions in `app/db.py`:
- `create_deal_rooms_table()`, `create_room()`, `get_room()`, `update_room_buyer()`

New frontend files:
- `frontend/src/pages/LandingPage.jsx` — seller registration + hero
- `frontend/src/pages/WaitingRoom.jsx` — split panel, polls `/status` every 3s, buyer join flow
- `frontend/src/api/roomApi.js` — room API calls
- `frontend/src/hooks/useAuth.js` — localStorage token store keyed by room_id

Design system colors added to `tailwind.config.js`: `dp-bg`, `dp-surface`, `dp-border`, `dp-teal`, `dp-amber`, `dp-red`, `dp-text`, `dp-muted`.

Token strategy: 64-char hex random token, stored in `deal_rooms.seller_token` / `buyer_token`. Expiry 2h, checked client-side via `dp_auth_{room_id}` in localStorage.

Route split in `App.jsx`: new pages (`/`, `/room/:room_id`) are full-screen standalone layouts. Legacy pages (`/deals`, `/create`, `/deal/:id`) keep the old NavBar layout via `LegacyLayout` + `Outlet`.

**Stop after Phase 1 — wait for instructions before building Phase 2 (Deal Configuration).**

### Phase 2 — Deal Configuration ✅ Complete

New endpoints in `app/api/room_routes.py`:
- `PUT /api/room/{room_id}/config` — seller only (`X-Room-Token`); saves `deal_payload` JSON to DB, status → `configuring`
- `POST /api/room/{room_id}/confirm` — seller or buyer; sets `seller_confirmed`/`buyer_confirmed`; both set → status `confirmed`

`floor_price` is always stripped from `GET /api/room/{room_id}/status` response before it reaches the client. Only the backend holds the real floor price for DealCreate construction (Phase 3).

New db functions: `save_room_config()`, `confirm_room_participant()` (returns `(seller_confirmed, buyer_confirmed)` tuple). ALTER TABLE migrations added to `create_deal_rooms_table()` for Phase 1 installs.

New frontend page: `frontend/src/pages/DealConfig.jsx` at `/room/:room_id/config`.
- Seller: full form (dataset type, description, asking price, floor price, budget, requirements, quality expandable, escrow toggle) + Save + Confirm
- Buyer: read-only summary (no floor price) + Confirm
- WaitingRoom auto-redirects to this page when status ≥ `configuring`
- Both confirmed → status `confirmed` → placeholder for Phase 3 negotiation trigger

`roomApi.js` additions: `saveRoomConfig(roomId, token, config)`, `confirmRoom(roomId, token)`.

**Stop after Phase 2 — wait for instructions before building Phase 3 (Live Negotiation View).**

### Phase 3 — Live Negotiation View ✅ Complete

New endpoints in `app/api/room_routes.py`:
- `POST /api/room/{room_id}/start` — seller or buyer; atomic `confirmed → running` transition; creates deal record; fires `_negotiate_and_complete_room()` as `BackgroundTask`; idempotent (second caller returns existing `deal_id`)

New db functions in `app/db.py`:
- `start_room_deal(room_id, deal_id)` — `UPDATE WHERE status='confirmed'`, returns bool (True = first caller wins)
- `update_room_status(room_id, status)` — set room to `complete` or `failed` after negotiation background task finishes

`_negotiate_and_complete_room()` in `room_routes.py`:
- Builds `DealCreate` from stored `deal_payload`; uses SHA-256 of `data_description` as placeholder `data_hash`
- Calls `_negotiate_deal(deal_id, deal_create)` (imported from `routes.py`)
- Marks room `complete` or `failed`

`roomApi.js` addition: `startRoomDeal(roomId, token)`.

New frontend files:
- `frontend/src/pages/NegotiationView.jsx` — 3-panel layout (transcript · trust stack · quality panel)
  - On mount: GET room status → if `confirmed` call `/start` → get `deal_id`; if already `running` use room's `deal_id`
  - Polls `GET /api/deals/{dealId}/status` every 2s until `agreed` or `failed`
  - Transcript rows revealed 380ms apart, fade+slide in; live elapsed timer; agreed price banner on close
  - "View Credential →" button on agreement → `/room/:room_id/credential` (Phase 4)
- `frontend/src/components/TrustStackBar.jsx` — 4-layer fill bars (TDX · DCAP · CONTEXTO · πCREDS); `600ms ease` width transition
- `frontend/src/components/QualityPanel.jsx` — SVG radial ring (completeness %), per-column null rate bars, schema consistency badge

`App.jsx` addition: `/room/:room_id/negotiate` → `NegotiationView`.
`DealConfig.jsx` update: redirects to `/negotiate` when status in `[confirmed, running, complete]`.

**Stop after Phase 3 — wait for instructions before building Phase 4 (Credential Display + Download).**

### Phase 4 — Credential Display + Download ✅ Complete

New frontend page: `frontend/src/pages/CredentialView.jsx` at `/room/:room_id/credential`.

Data flow:
- `getRoomStatus(room_id)` → `deal_id`
- `getDealStatus(deal_id)` → full `DealResult`
- Renders credential card; handles loading/error/no-deal states gracefully

Credential card sections:
- Header: "✓ DEAL ATTESTED" badge, ARBITRATED/πCREDS tags, SHARE + DOWNLOAD JSON buttons
- Key metrics: agreed price, round count, genuine negotiation flag
- Auditor summary (if `audit_report.summary` present)
- πCREDS conduct: `buyer_budget_respected`, `seller_floor_respected`, `no_sudden_capitulation`, `convergence_pattern_valid` + assessment text (if conduct cred present)
- Data quality: completeness %, verdict, issues, quality_hash (if `data_quality_report` present)
- Attestation hashes: TDX QUOTE (with VERIFY link → `/api/deals/{id}/dcap-verify`), PICREDS HASH, MEMORY PRE/POST/CTX, DATA VERIFY — each with inline COPY button
- Blockchain badges: Hedera tx, escrow deposit/release tx (shown only if present)

Post-deal actions: "← Start a new deal", "Export for audit →" (JSON download).
`App.jsx`: added `/room/:room_id/credential` → `CredentialView`.

**Stop after Phase 4 — wait for instructions before building Phase 5 (Dataset Upload).**

### Phase 6 — Public Credential Verification ✅ Complete

New backend endpoint in `app/api/room_routes.py`:
- `GET /api/room/{room_id}/public` — no auth; returns `deal_id` + `status` + `seller_name` for completed rooms only

New frontend page: `frontend/src/pages/PublicCredentialView.jsx` at `/verify/:deal_id`:
- No auth required — uses existing `getDealStatus()` + `getDcapVerification()` which need no token
- `DcapBadge` component: fetches `/dcap-verify` on load; shows teal "VERIFIED BY INTEL TDX" (production) or amber "TEE SIMULATION MODE" (sim)
- Same credential card as `CredentialView` but read-only (no download button)
- "COPY LINK" copies current URL; footer "Start your own deal →" links to `/`

`CredentialView.jsx` SHARE button updated: now copies `/verify/{deal_id}` (public URL) instead of the room credential URL.
`App.jsx`: added `/verify/:deal_id` → `PublicCredentialView`.

### Phase 7 — Deal History Dashboard ✅ Complete

New db function in `app/db.py`:
- `get_rooms_by_token(token)` — `SELECT … WHERE seller_token = ? OR buyer_token = ? ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50`; infers `role` from which token matched

New backend endpoint in `app/api/room_routes.py`:
- `GET /api/room/history` — `X-Room-Token` auth; returns list of rooms the token-holder participated in

New frontend page: `frontend/src/pages/HistoryPage.jsx` at `/history`:
- Scans localStorage for all `dp_auth_*` keys; skips expired tokens
- Batch-fetches all room statuses in parallel via `getRoomStatus()`; sorts newest-first
- Card per room: status badge, role badge (SELLER/BUYER), names, deal ID prefix, date, CTA
  - Complete → "View Credential →" (`/verify/{deal_id}`)
  - Running/confirmed → "Rejoin Negotiation →" (`/room/{id}/negotiate`)
  - Other → "Open Room →" (`/room/{id}`)
- Empty state: "No deals yet. Start one →"

`App.jsx`: added `/history` → `HistoryPage`.
`LandingPage.jsx`: added "View past deals →" link below the Create Deal Room CTA.

**Stop after Phase 7 — wait for instructions before building further phases.**

### Phase 5 — Dataset Upload ✅ Complete

New backend endpoint in `app/api/room_routes.py`:
- `POST /api/room/{room_id}/dataset` — seller only; accepts `.csv`, `.json`, `.jsonl` up to 50 MB
  - `_chunk_and_hash()`: splits into 1 MB chunks → SHA-256 each → `compute_merkle_root()`
  - `_quality_preview()`: parses up to 10,000 rows → null rates, completeness, issues, verdict
  - Returns: `corpus_root`, `seller_proof`, `file_size_bytes`, `chunk_count`, `filename`, `quality_preview`
- Updated `POST /{room_id}/start`: uses `corpus_root` + `seller_proof` + `quality_metrics` from `deal_payload` if present; falls back to description-hash for no-upload path
- `DataQualityMetrics` now imported and constructed in `/start` from `quality_metrics` dict
- `python-multipart==0.0.32` added to `requirements.txt`

Schema changes in `app/api/room_schemas.py`:
- `DealConfigRequest` gains optional: `corpus_root: str | None`, `seller_proof: dict | None`, `quality_metrics: dict | None`

New `uploadDataset(roomId, token, file)` in `frontend/src/api/roomApi.js` (raw FormData fetch, no Content-Type header).

Frontend changes in `frontend/src/pages/DealConfig.jsx`:
- Added `DatasetUpload` component (above seller form): drag-and-drop zone, auto-upload on file select, quality preview display
- `SellerConfigForm` gains `uploadResult` state + `useEffect` that auto-enables quality toggle and pre-fills thresholds
- `handleSave` includes `corpus_root`, `seller_proof`, `quality_metrics` in the config payload
- No-upload path (no file) is fully unaffected
